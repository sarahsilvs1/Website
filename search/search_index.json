My name is Sarah, and I'm currently a first year MSc student McGill University. Originally from just outside of New York City, I completed my undergraduate degree in astrophysics and earth science at Columbia University in May 2024. I have always been drawn to telling stories and making people laugh, and I hope to leverage this passion to make science more engaging and approachable for a general audience. I not only want to be a researcher who advances knowledge within the scientific community, but one who leverages her position to teach and inspire others. Interests beyond research!

I have spent the past four years as an elementary school math tutor in the afterschool program Reading Team Math, and I spent my second and third years of undergrad as the director of public outreach for Columbia's astronomy club Blueshift. Now in Montreal I'm excited to continue to engage the public in the sciences through tutoring and outreach events with the Trottier Space Institute.","title":"Outreach"},{"location":"projects/","text":"Projects Here are some presentations I gave as an undergraduate student. Exciting Detection of Low-Metallicity Stars is a presentation I gave summarizing the results of recently published paper about how population II stars may elucidate properties of the early universe. G32.64+0.53 Analysis is my first major presentation on the pulsar wind nebula G32.64+0.53, which I analyzed throughout my time in a high-energy astrophysics lab two years ago. I presented my results to the Galactic TeV Source Collaboration.","title":"Projects"},{"location":"projects/#projects","text":"Here are some presentations I gave as an undergraduate student.

I am currently investigating this question in the context of the formation and evolution of ice sheets, in particular on planets around red dwarf stars where the vast majority of earthlike exoplanets are found. Ice sheets are a critical factor to consider when discussing the possibility for life beyond Earth, as they not only govern the availability of liquid surface water but also interact with a planet's climate system and surface. Many of these red dwarf planets reside in compact planetary systems where gravitational interactions with neighboring planets can influence their rotation. These interactions may result in \"chaotic\" rotational states unlike what we know of in our own solar system. My project is specifically simulating how these rotational states impact ice sheets, climate, and surface deformation, and thus ultimately, the habitability of these planets. I feel empowered by the notion that as we progress our understanding of planets at the far reaches of our galaxy, this research still has direct connections to\u2014and even implications for\u2014what we know about Earth. Prior to my time at McGill, I pursued a diverse range of research experiences, spanning high-energy astrophysics, atmospheric science, and geophysics.
