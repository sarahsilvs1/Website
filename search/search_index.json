I'm currently a first-year MSc student in the Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences at McGill University, working under the co-supervision of Dr. Nicolas Cowan and Dr. Natalya Gomez. As a member of both the McGill Exoplanet Characterization Alliance and the Trottier Insitute for Research on Exoplanets, I'm using numerical simulations to study ice sheet formation and evolution on M-dwarf planets, including their implications for habitability.</p> <p>In addition to research, I'm super passionate about scientific outreach! I especially enjoyed working as an elementary school math tutor in a Columbia-led afterschool program, and I'm excited to continue outreach during her my time in Montreal.</p>"},{"location":"about/#other-interests","title":"Other interests","text":"<ul> <li>Comedy, Storytelling, and Improv</li> </ul>"},{"location":"about/#cv","title":"CV","text":""},{"location":"about/Comedy/","title":"Comedy","text":"<p>I love sketch and stand-up comedy, storytelling, and improv!</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> </p>"},{"location":"outreach/","title":"Scientific Public Outreach and Engagement","text":"<p>I am drawn to roles that connect with and inspire others, and I have worked with people of all backgrounds and ages, from first graders to adults.

I spent my time in two different research groups, investigating patterns of sea level change due to the melting of ice sheets and glaciers, as well as the causes and frequency of cold surges in subtropics/tropics.
