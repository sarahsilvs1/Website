I'm a first-year Master's student at McGill University in the Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences co-supervised by Nic Cowan and Natalya Gomez. I'm currently using numerical simulations to study ice sheet formation and evolution on Earth-like exoplanets, including their implications for habitability. You can learn more about me here . You can also find an introduction to my research and my CV . Always looking to connect!

As a member of both the McGill Exoplanet Characterization Alliance and the Trottier Insitute for Research on Exoplanets, I'm using numerical simulations to study ice sheet formation and evolution on M-dwarf planets, including their implications for habitability. In addition to research, I'm super passionate about scientific outreach !

Now in Montreal I'm excited to continue to engage the public in the sciences through tutoring and outreach events with the Trottier Space Institute.","title":"Outreach"},{"location":"projects/","text":"Projects Here are some presentations I gave as an undergraduate student. Exciting Detection of Low-Metallicity Stars is a presentation I gave summarizing the results of recently published paper about how population II stars may elucidate properties of the early universe.
