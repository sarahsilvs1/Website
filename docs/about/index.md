# Introduction

Welcome! My name is Sarah, and I'm currently a first year MSc student McGill University. Originally from just outside of New York City, I completed my undergraduate degree in astrophysics and earth science at Columbia University in May 2024. 

I have always been drawn to telling stories and making people laugh, and I hope to leverage this passion to make science more engaging and approachable for a general audience. I not only want to be a researcher who advances knowledge within the scientific community, but one who teaches and inspires others.
