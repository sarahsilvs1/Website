# Introduction

![Columbia Grad](./media/IMG_7534.jpeg "Me"){align="center": style="height:700;width:700px"}

I'm a recent graduate of Columbia University (just this past May!) where I studied both astrophysics and earth science. I'm currently a first-year MSc student in the Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences at McGill University, working under the co-supervision of Dr. Nicolas Cowan and Dr. Natalya Gomez. As a member of both the McGill Exoplanet Characterization Alliance and the Trottier Insitute for Research on Exoplanets, I'm using numerical simulations to study ice sheet formation and evolution on M-dwarf planets, including their implications for habitability.

In addition to research, I'm super passionate about [scientific outreach](../outreach/index.md)! I especially enjoyed working as an elementary school math tutor in a Columbia-led afterschool program, and I'm excited to continue outreach during her my time in Montreal.
