# Research Interests

During my first and second years of undergrad, I analyzed data from the NuSTAR x-ray telescope as a member of a high-energy astrophysics research group. I subsequently pivoted my research focus to planetary sciences and spent my senior year working at Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory. I spent my time in two different research groups, investigating patterns of sea level change due to the melting of ice sheets and glaciers, as well as the causes and frequency of cold surges in subtropics/tropics. Now I am studying exoplanetary science where I hope to merge my interests in astronomy and earth science.
