Hi everyone! I'm a dedicated planetary sciences graduate student committed to unraveling the nature of Earth-like exoplanets around M-dwarf stars. If you'd like to learn more [about me](./about/index.md), you can find an introduction to [my research](./reasearch/index.md) and some info on some [recent projects](./projects/index.md).
