Hi everyone! I'm a first year  Master's student at McGill University in the Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences and the Trottier Space Institute co-supervised by Nic Cowan and Natalya Gomez. I'm currently using numerical simulations to study ice sheet formation and evolution on Earth-like exoplanets, including their implications for habitability. 

Click [here](./about/index.md) to learn more about me. You can also find an introduction to my [research](./research/index.md) and my [CV](./Sarah_Silverman_CV.pdf).

Always looking to connect! Email me at sarah.a.silverman@mail.mcgill.ca
