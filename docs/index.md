Hi everyone! I'm a dedicated planetary sciences graduate student committed to unraveling the nature of Earth-like exoplanets around M-dwarf stars. 
I extend a formal welcome to all who wish to engage with the frontiers of astrophysics through the lens of my ongoing research endeavors.


If you're like to learn more about me, you can find an introduction to [my research](./reasearch/index.md), some info on some [recent projects](./projects/index.md) and some more info [about me](./about/index.md).
