# Research Interests
My research interests lie at the intersection between earth science and astronomy: how can we apply the physics and climate science that we understand about Earth to exoplanets? I am currently investigating this question in the context of the formation and evolution of ice sheets, in particular on planets around red dwarf stars. Ice sheets are a critical factor to consider when discussing the possibility for life beyond Earth, as they not only govern the availability of liquid surface water but also interact with a planet's climate system and surface. 

The vast majority of earthlike exoplanets orbit these dim, cool stars, and many reside in compact planetary systems where gravitational interactions with neighboring planets can influence their rotation. These interactions may result in "chaotic" rotational states unlike what we know of in our own solar system. My project is specifically simulating how these rotational states impact ice sheets, climate, and surface deformation, and thus ultimately, the habitability of these planets.

I feel empowered by the notion that as we progress our understanding of planets at the far reaches of our galaxy, this research still has direct connections to—and even implications for—what we know about Earth.
 
Prior to my time at McGill, I pursued a diverse range of research experiences, spanning high-energy astrophysics, atmospheric science, and geophysics.
