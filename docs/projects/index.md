# Projects

Here are some presentations I gave as an undergraduate student. 

- [Exciting Detection of Low-Metallicity Stars](./Silverman_Observational_Presentation.pdf) is a presentation I gave summarizing the results of recently published paper about how population II stars may elucidate properties of the early universe.
- [G32.64+0.53 Analysis](./Revised Presentation G32.64+0.53 for Collaborators.pptx.pdf) is my first major presentation on the pulsar wind nebula G32.64+0.53, which I analyzed throughout my time in a high-energy astrophysics lab two years ago. I presented my results to the Galactic TeV Source Collaboration.
